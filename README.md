# TheMovieDatabase_Analysis

# Introduction
This Project will be focused on investigating The Movie Database (TMDb) which contains various information about 10,000 movies such as their genres, runtime, ratings, budget, revenue etc.

We will be investigating the following key questions:

Which are the most popular genres?
Most profitable and least profitable movie of all time?
Does all high budget movies generates high profit?
Does more movies release in recent time than back in the days?
Are current generation movies lengthier or shorter than old generation movies?
How much has the movie industry grown over the years?
Which are the top 10 Production Companies with maximum number of movie releases?


# Conclusion
This section concludes the observation made during explaratory data analysis:

1. Drama is the most popular movie genre followed by Comedy, Action and Thriller, which are almost equally popular.
2. 'Avatar' is the most profitable movie and the least profitable movie is 'The Warrior's Way'
3. Compared to the 10 most profitable movies with the exception of "Avenger: Age of Ultron", none of the 10 best high-budget movies is on the list of the 10 most profitable movies, which is quite a surprise. The Warrior's Way is the movie with the highest budget compared to the profit made, the number speaks quite the opposite. Well, it is definitely to be said that not all high budget films are highly profitable.

4. There is no comparison to the number of movies released in recent times to the old days. The volume of movie released from year 2000 is exponentially high. However, 2014 year has the highest release of movies (700) followed by year 2013 (659) and year 2015 (629).

5. It is also observed that current generation movies(2000 year onwards) are much shorter in length as compared to old generation movies. The present movie avg runtime is close to 100mins Vs ~115 mins movies in the past(1960-1980). Hence,average movie runtimes are generally decreasing with time starting from the 120 minute average down to around 95 today.

6. It is also observed that the movie industry has been growing exponentially over the past 50 years. The releases are almost 7 fold from 1990 to present.

7. 'Universal Pictures', 'Warner Bros.', 'paramount Pictures' are the top production companies with maximum movie releases.
